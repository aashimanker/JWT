# JWT Implementation

This repository demonstrates the implementation and usage of **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for secure authentication and data exchange in web applications.

## Features

- Secure token-based authentication
- Token generation and verification
- Role-based access control (optional)
- Step-by-step guide to implement JWT in your application

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** for backend logic
- **Express.js** for API creation
- **jsonwebtoken** package for JWT operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### API Endpoints
- POST /api/register: Authenticates the user and returns a JWT.
- GET /api/user: Access protected routes using a valid token.

### How It Works
- Users authenticate with their credentials.
- The server generates a JWT signed with a secret key.
- The client stores the token (e.g., in local storage or cookies).
- The client includes the token in the Authorization header for protected routes.
- The server verifies the token and grants access if valid.
